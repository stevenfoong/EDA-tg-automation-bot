# EDA-tg-automation-bot
Telegram Automation Bot using Event-driven architecture

The code was generated by ChatGPT and Gemini.

I modified base on my need.

The AWS worker was intentionally developed in Go to showcase that the event-driven architecture (EDA) can support multiple languages working simultaneously.

You will need two telegram bot.
One is to receive order, which you will configure the token into input-tg env
Another one is to send message, which you will configure the token into output-tg env
